Web-service database of web sites showing URL, title, author, date published, publisher of sites chosen by users. 

The initial aim is to code enough that chosen users can start entering data, but the larger project can be read at

Initial version to have manual data entry (copy and paste from an open browser), but later versions would automate much of the data entry (user pastes in URL, software searches that location and extracts the relevant data)
